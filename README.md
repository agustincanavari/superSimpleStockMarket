J.P. Morgan's coding excercise

This solution consists of a Python 3.x script that provides a menu for users to interface with the program.
Using the program, users can:

        1) Upload a csv file containing available stocks and their properties.
        
        2) Calculate dividend yield and P/E Ratio for any given stock
        
        3) Record a trade for any given stock
        
        4) Calculate the VWSP based on the past 5 minutes trades
        
        5) Calculate GBCE for all trades

Test input is provided as a CSV.
The program assumes input files contains no errors or duplicates
